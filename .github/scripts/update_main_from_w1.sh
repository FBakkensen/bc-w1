# `w1-XX` branch in StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History.
# It creates ONE commit that contains the diff to the previous state,
# while preserving the .github folder (so the workflow keeps working).
#
# Steps:
#   1. Ensure both remotes (origin, upstream) exist and fetch all refs
#   2. Find the highest-numbered upstream w1-XX branch
#   3. Determine the version currently stored on main
#   4. If main is outdated, update it with the latest upstream branch (preserving .github)
#   5. Commit and push the update
